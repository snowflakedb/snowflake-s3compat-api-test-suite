## Readme file

This Repo is a S3Compat API Test Suite.

## Requirements for private repositories

This repository is intended to be private during implementation, please see the [CM requirements](https://snowflakecomputing.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~367958958/pages/671909031/Creating+a+new+repository).
We will make it public after impl is done and then we would update this Readme file.
